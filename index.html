	<h3>Connor</h3>
	<p>I am a avid consumer and content creator among fictional universes from Star Wars to D&D. I focus on software engineering, 
	have published several works, and have conducted audio work for Bayou Cirque. Work that I am carrying over to Covered Skies by being the team lead 
	to produce a game of proper satisfaction.</p><br>

	<h3>Kohl</h3>
	<p>I am a Computer Science student with a minor in Mathematics.  I am the Web Developer that designed this website, 
	and my other responsibilities are to help Austin and Jacob with scripting and programming.  I have played a significant amount 
	of video games over the years and am interested in making one.</p><br>

	<h3>Madison</h3>
	<p>I’m currently a senior General Arts major with dual minors in Digital Media Arts Engineering and Art History. I’ll be the 
	head of graphics for our team, and will focus on producing an aesthetically pleasing game. I don’t play as many games as I wish 
	I did, but every now and then when I’m free I’ll play Minecraft. I love storytelling, character design, and illustration, 
	and how they can add to a game’s narrative!</p><br>

	<h3>Austin</h3>
	<p>I am a Computer Science student with a focus on Software Engineering. I am the Lead Programmer responsible 
	for scripting and game mechanic implementation, with my other responsibilities being helping Kohl and Jacob 
	with scripting and programming. I don't play as many games as I used to, however I still enjoy an occasional Dark Souls run.</p><br>

	<h3>Jacob</h3>
	<p>Hello! I’m Jacob Carter, a Computer Science and Electrical Engineering double major at LSU. 
	I’ve loved video games since I was a kid, growing up with the Wii and Xbox 360. 
	Nowadays I love platformers and fighting games, with HollowKnight and Super Smash Bros. 
	Melee being my favorite game of all time. I don’t currently plan on going into the games industry after college, 
	but I enjoy making games as a hobby to express myself.</p><br>
